**Global COâ‚‚ Emissions Dashboard**
ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This Tableau project visualizes global carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions trends from 1960 to 2023 using historical data from various countries. The dashboard provides insights into emission levels, top contributors, year-over-year changes, and global patterns, supporting environmental research and policy analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Dataset Name: Global COâ‚‚ Emissions Dataset

Rows: 13,953

Columns: 4

Time Period: 1960â€“2023

**Column Description**

1.country_code â€“ ISO 3-letter country code

2.country_name â€“ Full country name

3.year â€“ Year of emission data

4.value â€“ COâ‚‚ emissions in kilotonnes (kt)

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1.Renamed value to CO2_Emissions_kt for clarity.

2.Ensured year is treated as a dimension for trend analysis.

3.Removed records where emissions data was missing (NULL).

4.Created calculated fields:

  -CO2_Emissions_mt (megatonnes) = CO2_Emissions_kt / 1000

  -Year-on-Year % Change = (Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year * 100

ðŸ“ˆ Visual Analysis

1.Bar Chart â€“ Top 10 COâ‚‚ Emitting Countries (Latest Year)

2.Scatter Plot â€“ Global COâ‚‚ Emissions Trend (1960â€“2023)

3.Map Visualization â€“ COâ‚‚ Emissions by Country (Latest Year)

4.Area Chart â€“ Stacked Emissions by Continent/Region

ðŸ–¥ Interactive Dashboards

1.Filters & Slicers:

  -Year range slider

  -Dropdown for country_name selection

2.Highlight Table â€“ Emissions Heatmap by Country and Year

3.Interactive Scatter Plot â€“ Emissions vs. Year with trend insights

ðŸš€ Key Insights
